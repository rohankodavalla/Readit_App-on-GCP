after some issues encountered in data store services part (as commented in that respective commit at the folder location),
found out that catalog vm is not working,meaning the load balancer didnt work and always gave "unhealthy upstream" , so had to setup 
catalog from scratch, connect to sql,redis,load balancer and change the ips correspondingly in sql, load balancer firewall etc.

so uploading latest catlaog file and rest of otherstoo
